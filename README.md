eurostatDb.js
=============

Retrieve and store data from eurostat's API.

Eurostat provides a wealth of information -- it's just pretty hard to get to and use. It provides the data over its [API](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/sdmx_web_services/getting_started/rest_sdmx_2.1) in a very 'rich' xml format that is a bit too overwhelming for many uses. This library aims at making things easier for use in javascript web applications.

## I promise

The code has been rewritten to use promises instead of callbacks, so that there are now 2 versions:
* v0: (deprecated) uses callbacks
* v1: uses promises

There is no compatibility between the versions. The use of v1+ is encouraged.


## Sample use
v1 (current):
```js
db = eurostatDb();
db.tblQinit("demo_pjan", {FREQ: "A", AGE: "TOTAL"}, {startYear: 1995, endYear: 2015}); //1
db.rstQ("demo_pjan", {SEX: "T", GEO: "NL"}, "TIME ASEC") //2
    .then(function (rst) {
        $("div#info").prepend("<h2>Total population in the Netherlands:</h2>");
        rst.forEach(function (r) {$("ul").append("<li>In " + r.TIME + ": " + r.OBS_VALUE + "</li>");});//3
    })
    .catch(function (e) {alert(e);});
```

## Dependencies

eurostatDb.js depends on 
* jQuery (http://jquery.com/)
* q (https://github.com/kriskowal/q) to provide promises
* xml2json (https://github.com/abdmob/x2js) to convert xml into json
* taffydb (https://github.com/typicaljoe/taffydb) to store information

so be sure to include those. 

Also, the file `all_latest_ESTAT_references=none_detail=full.xml` which contains the dataflow names and descriptions, must be located in the `js/` directory.
